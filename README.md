# F-SpeechSynthesisTutorial
Conversion of my C# speech synthesis tutorial into an F# speech synthesis tutorial, complete with code comments

Speech synthesis in F# with the .NET Framework and utilizing the Chinese Vice option. This console app accepts English characters only. If you are running Windows 10 and try this without the language pack installed, the exception will be thrown. However, it is very easy to download the language pack and can be done without requiring a restart.

Go to Settings, Time & Language, click on the box that says Add a language. Locate the Chinese language pack and select to download it as well as the speech pack. (Simplified Chinese or Traditional Chinese language area) Microsoft Huihui Desktop should work with either one.
